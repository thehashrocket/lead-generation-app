## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. The
skill has multi-step workflows, checklists, and quality gates that produce better
results than an ad-hoc answer. When in doubt, invoke the skill. A false positive is
cheaper than a false negative.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy, scope, "think bigger", "what should we build" → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture, "does this design make sense" → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system, brand, "how should this look" → invoke /design-consultation
- Design review of a plan → invoke /plan-design-review
- Developer experience of a plan → invoke /plan-devex-review
- "Review everything", full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", "wtf", "this doesn't work" → invoke /investigate
- Test the site, find bugs, "does this work" → invoke /qa (or /qa-only for report only)
- Code review, check the diff, "look at my changes" → invoke /review
- Visual polish, design audit, "this looks off" → invoke /design-review
- Developer experience audit, try onboarding → invoke /devex-review
- Ship, deploy, create a PR, "send it" → invoke /ship
- Merge + deploy + verify → invoke /land-and-deploy
- Configure deployment → invoke /setup-deploy
- Post-deploy monitoring → invoke /canary
- Update docs after shipping → invoke /document-release
- Weekly retro, "how'd we do" → invoke /retro
- Second opinion, codex review → invoke /codex
- Safety mode, careful mode, lock it down → invoke /careful or /guard
- Restrict edits to a directory → invoke /freeze or /unfreeze
- Upgrade gstack → invoke /gstack-upgrade
- Save progress, "save my work" → invoke /context-save
- Resume, restore, "where was I" → invoke /context-restore
- Security audit, OWASP, "is this secure" → invoke /cso
- Make a PDF, document, publication → invoke /make-pdf
- Launch real browser for QA → invoke /open-gstack-browser
- Import cookies for authenticated testing → invoke /setup-browser-cookies
- Performance regression, page speed, benchmarks → invoke /benchmark
- Review what gstack has learned → invoke /learn
- Tune question sensitivity → invoke /plan-tune
- Code quality dashboard → invoke /health

## Website scraping policy (v0.4.0+)

`lib/services/orgs/website-enrichment.ts` fetches per-org nonprofit websites
to extract mission text and named programs. The policy:

- **User-Agent**: `VolunteerReady/1.0 (outreach research tool; contact: jasshultz@gmail.com)` — identifies the tool and provides a contact for any operator who wants us to stop.
- **Total budget**: a single 12s `AbortController` deadline shared across the entire `/about → /about-us → /our-mission → /mission → /programs → /what-we-do → /` priority chain. First page returning ≥500 chars wins.
- **Body cap**: 1 MB per fetch. Anything larger returns null.
- **Robots.txt**: NOT fetched. This is per-org research-volume access (~50/week), not a crawler — robots.txt is meant to gate crawlers, and identifying-UA + low volume is the correct etiquette here.
- **Hard-stop on 403, 429**: the host has signaled enough.
- **Same-host redirects only**: cross-domain redirects (often ad networks / link shorteners) are followed only if the new host matches the original.
- **Concurrency**: per-host concurrency is enforced ONLY within a single request handler. Cross-instance/cross-request concurrency is not enforced (see TODOS.md). At 50 sends/wk the practical risk is near zero.

## GBrain Search Guidance (configured by /sync-gbrain)
<!-- gstack-gbrain-search-guidance:start -->

GBrain is set up and synced on this machine. The agent should prefer gbrain
over Grep when the question is semantic or when you don't know the exact
identifier yet.

**This worktree is pinned to a worktree-scoped code source** via the
`.gbrain-source` file in the repo root (kubectl-style context). Any
`gbrain code-def`, `code-refs`, `code-callers`, `code-callees`, or `query`
call from anywhere under this worktree routes to that source by default —
no `--source` flag needed. Conductor sibling worktrees of the same repo
each have their own pin and their own indexed pages, so semantic results
match the actual code on disk in this worktree.

Two indexed corpora available via the `gbrain` CLI:
- This worktree's code (auto-pinned via `.gbrain-source`).
- `~/.gstack/` curated memory (registered as `gstack-brain-<user>` source via
  the existing federation pipeline).

Prefer gbrain when:
- "Where is X handled?" / semantic intent, no exact string yet:
    `gbrain search "<terms>"` or `gbrain query "<question>"`
- "Where is symbol Y defined?" / symbol-based code questions:
    `gbrain code-def <symbol>` or `gbrain code-refs <symbol>`
- "What calls Y?" / "What does Y depend on?":
    `gbrain code-callers <symbol>` / `gbrain code-callees <symbol>`
- "What did we decide last time?" / past plans, retros, learnings:
    `gbrain search "<terms>" --source gstack-brain-<user>`

Grep is still right for known exact strings, regex, multiline patterns, and
file globs. Run `/sync-gbrain` after meaningful code changes; for ongoing
auto-sync across all worktrees, run `gbrain autopilot --install` once per
machine — gbrain's daemon handles incremental refresh on a schedule.
